# C-Programs
C is a general-purpose, procedural, high-level programming language.
C is one of the most widely used programming languages.
The main features of the C language include: General Purpose and Portable ,Low-level Memory Access ,Fast Speed,Clean Syntax.
Below I have Written a basic review of all the programs:-
1)Vowel or Consonant-This C program determines whether a given character is a vowel or a consonant.It checks the input character against the set of vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and provides the corresponding output.
2)Even-Odd number -This C program checks whether a given number is even or odd. It uses the modulo operator to determine if the input number is divisible by 2. If the remainder is zero, the number is even; otherwise, it is odd.
3)Inverted half  pyramid- This C program generates an inverted half pyramid pattern using asterisks (*). The user specifies the number of rows, and the program prints a pyramid with decreasing width.
4)Positive-Negative Program-This C program determines whether a given number is positive or negative. It checks if the input number is greater than, equal to, or less than zero to determine its sign and provides the appropriate output.
5)Prime Number Program- This C program checks whether a given number is a prime number. It verifies if the input number is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. If not, it is considered a prime number.
6)Print Alphabets Program- This C program prints the English alphabets in uppercase. It uses a loop to iterate through the ASCII values corresponding to the alphabets and prints them sequentially.
7)Reverse Number Program- This C program reverses a given number. It uses a while loop and modulo operation to extract digits from the original number and construct the reversed number.
14)Right Triangle Program- This C program generates a right-angled triangle pattern using asterisks (*). The user specifies the number of rows, and the program prints a right-angled triangle with increasing width.
15)Triangle Program- This C program generates an equilateral triangle pattern using asterisks (*). The user specifies the number of rows, and the program prints a triangle with a constant width.
16) Factorial Program- This C program calculates the factorial of a given non-negative integer. It uses a loop to multiply the numbers from 1 to the given integer to compute the factorial.
17)Half Pyramid Program-This C program generates a half pyramid pattern using asterisks (*). The user specifies the number of rows, and the program prints a pyramid with increasing width.
18)Sum Digits Program- This C program calculates the sum of the digits of a given positive integer. It uses a loop and modulo operation to extract individual digits and adds them to find the sum.
19)Table Program-This C program prints the multiplication table of a given number. It uses a loop to calculate and display the product of the given number with each integer from 1 to 10.
